# REAPER Edit Tools

Standalone Lua scripts for editing multitrack audio with ease in REAPER.

## Workflow

1. Create regions representing different takes
2. Render those regions to audio files (proxy items)
3. Re-import rendered files as proxy items
4. Stack proxy items vertically to compare takes
5. Pick your favorite edits from each take
6. Convert selected proxies back to multitrack audio for detailed mixing

Drop scripts into REAPER's Scripts folder and assign to actions for quick access.
